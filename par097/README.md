# Brain Tumor MRI Classification (par097)

Educational project for Professional Training (YN3012170034).
A web app that classifies brain MRI images into 4 classes (glioma, meningioma, no tumor, pituitary tumor)
and shows a Grad-CAM heatmap of where the model looked.

**This is not a medical diagnosis tool.**

## Model
- ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for 3 epochs (transfer learning).
- Test accuracy: 94.2% on 1,600 test images.
- Weights: https://huggingface.co/santaparvin/brain-mri-resnet18

## Dataset
Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Masoud Nickparvar, Kaggle):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvin/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository.

## How to run
1. Install the libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the app: `python app.py` (the model weights download automatically from Hugging Face)
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:7860 and upload an MRI image.

## Train the model yourself
1. Download the dataset and unzip it so it contains the folders Training and Testing.
2. Run: `python train.py --data_dir "path/to/dataset" --epochs 3`

## Files
- `train.py` - fine-tunes ResNet-18 and prints the evaluation report
- `app.py` - Gradio web app with prediction and Grad-CAM
- `class_names.json` - class labels
- `requirements.txt` - libraries

## Limitations
The model confuses glioma and meningioma in some cases (glioma recall 0.835).
It was trained on one public dataset only and has no clinical validation.

An AI assistant (Claude) was used for learning support and debugging.
